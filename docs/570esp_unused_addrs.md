title: fx-570ES+ VerE Unused Functions
layout: default

This page contains a list of addresses in the `GY454X VerE` real ROM that follow a `POP PC`, `RT`, `RTI` or `BAL` instruction but never get called or jumped to.

This list was created with the help of [PyU8disas](https://github.com/gamingwithevets/pyu8disas), my nX-U8/100 disassembler, which is still in active development. Therefore the list may not be 100% accurate and may get updated over time.
